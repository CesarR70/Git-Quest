🗣️  "Okay, you've created a branch and made some changes. 
    But how do you get those changes back into the main branch?
    
    Enter git merge! It's how you combine the history of two 
    branches into one.
    
    First, you need to switch back to the main branch with 
    git checkout. Then merge your feature branch into it.
    
    The workflow:
    1. git checkout main      → Go back to main
    2. git merge feature-xxx  → Bring in the changes
    
    ⚠️  Warning: If both branches changed the same file, 
        you'll get a merge conflict! But that's a story 
        for another day...
    
    Your task:
    Switch back to main and merge the feature-login branch!"
